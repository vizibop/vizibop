At its core, Vizibop leverages CANVAS, HTML5 Audio, MediaRecorder, and P5.js which can generate a WEBM file with only front end code.  From there, that WEBM file is sent through AWS Elastic Transcoder to convert the WEBM file to a MP4 file which can then be shared on sites like Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube.

This repository is meants to share with other developers a means of creating a WEBM video from a dynamically generated canvas driven from an audio file, user configuration and a sprinkling of randomness.
